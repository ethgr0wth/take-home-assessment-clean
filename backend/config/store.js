      description: 'A fully decentralized lending and borrowing protocol that enables users to supply digital assets as collateral and borrow against them without intermediaries. The protocol implements isolated lending pools with dynamic interest rates based on utilization, ensuring that lenders earn competitive yields while borrowers pay fair rates that adapt to market demand. Automatic liquidation mechanisms protect the protocol from under-collateralized positions, with liquidation thresholds and bonus incentives configurable per asset. Governance is conducted through token-based voting, allowing the community to adjust risk parameters, add new markets, and upgrade protocol logic. Built with security-first principles including formal verification of critical paths and multiple independent audits from leading firms. Supports ETH, WBTC, USDC, DAI, and select blue-chip tokens across Ethereum mainnet. The protocol has processed over $2B in total volume since mainnet launch, with zero critical vulnerabilities discovered post-audit. Integrates with major DeFi aggregators and wallet providers for seamless onboarding.',

The user is moving yield farming profits to stablecoin savings after harvesting rewards from a liquidity pool or other DeFi strategy.

Polygon\'s low fees make such frequent rebalancing economically viable. The 2500 USDC amount suggests meaningful harvested yields from a position.',
